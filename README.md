# logging
It is a library where you can seperate the logs files according to their log level.


step 1 : Save both the python files in a folder 'loggingTutorial' and then create a folder in it named 'logs'.(there should be 2 py files and one folder in it)
step 2 : Run library.py 
step 3 : Run testing.py 
step 4 : Open the 'logs' folder and see the output.

Note: The files inside the logs folder are in timedRotatingFileHandler mode which means they will keep on updating in the given time interval.
