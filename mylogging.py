"""PROPAGATE:
 - If this attribute evaluates to true, events logged to this logger will be passed to the handlers of 
   higher level (ancestor) loggers, in addition to any handlers attached to this logger. Messages are
   passed directly to the ancestor loggersâ€™ handlers - neither the level nor filters of the ancestor
   loggers in question are considered.
 - If this evaluates to false, logging messages are not passed to the handlers of ancestor loggers.
 - The constructor sets this attribute to True.
Note : 
If you attach a handler to a logger and one or more of its ancestors, it may emit the same record multiple times.
In general, you should not need to attach a handler to more than one logger - if you just attach it to the
appropriate logger which is highest in the logger hierarchy, then it will see all events logged by all
descendant loggers, provided that their propagate setting is left set to True. A common scenario is to attach 
handlers only to the root logger, and to let propagation take care of the rest.
